# TIIP
a python script to place two strings from an excel spreadsheet and an image on a base template image.
This python script opens an excel sheet , reads the value from two corresponding columns(name and title). searches and opens for
a image file with the same name as 'name' from the excel sheet ,opens a base template image and writes both the strings and the
opened image onto the base template image. the text size changes according to the length of the characters.
path of the excel file , the image files(with the names in the same case as in the excel sheet) and the base template image needs
to be specified with the coordinates.

this can be used to write names of people on certificates if required in large amounts rather than mannually doing it.
